        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Derrick Phan</strong> and I am a <em>3rd year Computer Science major from Berkeley, CA studying at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, planning on graduating in 2026.</em> I am an aspiring Software Engineer who loves to build websites and applications that can help people or be used by others! Additionally, I am looking to build on my software engineering experience and expand my technical skillsets through more new software projects and experiences.</p>
        <p>Previously, I have had work experience as an Area Manager Intern at Amazon, and as a Math Tutor at Mathnasium Learning Center. On campus, I am involved with Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional co-ed business Fraternity, where I am the Director of Brotherhood. I am also the current President of the Cal Poly Club Table Tennis team, and I also hold in involvements in Nikkei Student Union and SLOHacks. Lastly, I work for Cal Poly's Bailey College of Science and Math as a Web Development Intern!</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing sports such as Table Tennis, Golf, and Basketball. I also enjoy lifting weights, playing video games, going out to try new foods and drinks, and hanging out with my friends and family.</p>
